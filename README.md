# Edi-Setup
Holds all necessary files to build a setup via WiX Toolset

Download all batch files in this folder into the same folder as the source files from the Edi project.

Lets assume, the Edi sources are contained in a folder named:
C:\data\edi\00_src

then you should download and store the batch files from this repository in:
C:\data\edi\10_setup

to bring the setup build files onto the same level as the source files.
